# JS1 - Markdown to HTML Converter

A small browser tool that converts basic Markdown into HTML and shows both the raw HTML and a live preview.

## Run

1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Type Markdown into the input box.
3. View the raw HTML and rendered preview side by side.

## Supported syntax

- Headings: #, ##, ### at the start of a line
- Blockquotes: > at the start of a line
- Images: ![alt](url)
- Links: [text](url)
- Bold: **text** or __text__
- Italic: *text* or _text_

## Notes

- Conversion is line-based and happens on each input change.
- HTML output is shown as text, preview is rendered.
