# FCC JavaScript Exercises

Small JavaScript practice folders with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.

## Structure

- JS1/ - HTML, CSS, and JS for exercise 1
- JS2/ - HTML, CSS, and JS for exercise 2
- JS3/ - JS-only exercise
- JS4/ - JS-only exercise
- JS5/ - HTML, CSS, and JS for exercise 5

## Use

Open any `index.html` file in a browser to run the corresponding exercise.
For JS-only folders, run the script in your browser console or a Node.js REPL.

## Notes

- Keep each exercise self-contained in its folder.
- Add new exercises as `JS6/`, `JS7/`, and so on.
